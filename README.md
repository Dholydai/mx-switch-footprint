# mx-switch-footprint
Custom Cherry MX switch footprints for KiCad

These footprints use the same format as the native Button_Switch_Keyboard.pretty KiCad library.

I moved The_Post-Mech_Praxis project to GitLab so these files might be added to the KiCad native library on GitLab.

This repository will removed if KiCad does incorporate the footprints.

Thank you GitHub, Dholydai
