# mx-switch-footprint
Custom Cherry MX switch footprints for KiCad needed for Post-Mecanical keyboards

Half of these footprints use the same format as the native Button_Switch_Keyboard.pretty KiCad library.
Half of these footprints use the common non-native format.

This repository will removed if KiCad incorporates the footprints.

Thank you GitHub, Dholydai
